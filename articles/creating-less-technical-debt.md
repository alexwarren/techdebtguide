Is the answer to technical debt simply to stop creating it in the first place? It's a nice idea, and there certainly are ways of reducing the amount of technical debt we create.

For example, a good code review process will ensure that we're not unintentionally shipping overly complex code. It can catch unnecessary code duplication, missing tests, and missing documentation.

Ensuring that developers have enough time to do a good job is also important. It's very easy for developers to over-commit, to take on more work than they can realistically handle, so it's good to push back where you can. Question urgency - the less rushed you are, the less technical debt you'll be creating in the first place.
