Do you have feedback about the Technical Debt Guide? An example of technical debt you have successfully fixed in your organisation? Do you have questions, or are you looking for advice?

If so, you can get in touch with me at <alex@techdebtguide.com>, or find me on Twitter [@alexwarren](https://twitter.com/alexwarren).
